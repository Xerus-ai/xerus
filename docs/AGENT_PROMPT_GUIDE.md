❌ DON'T specify universal behaviors:
   "Always use markdown formatting"
   "Never use meta-phrases"

❌ DON'T include response templates:
   "Respond in the following format..."
   "[INSERT USER QUERY HERE]"
```

### Redundant Instructions
```
❌ DON'T repeat orchestration features:
   "Use RAG when available"
   "Provide tool recommendations"
   "Include confidence scores"

❌ DON'T hardcode workflows:
   "First check knowledge base, then..."
   "If query is about X, do Y"
```

### Technical Implementation Details
```
❌ DON'T reference system internals:
   "Use the modality detection system"
   "Based on confidence scores"
   "When orchestration engine determines"
```
